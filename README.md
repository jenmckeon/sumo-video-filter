# sumo-video-filter
The Objective: Support the expansion of the Sumo product line with a best in class how-to video series - starring the new Sumo Stylers lineup.

This module features 18 looks on ten Bb.Stylists + Bb.Employees - each with a how-to video. You can filter each of the video by product, hair length, hair texture, and desired effect.

The filter functionality was coded in jQuery. It features checkboxes which deliver an “or” like filter functionality to add on filter options and ‘categories’ which deliver “and” like filter functionality to remove options.

If there are no videos present, an error message will be displayed that will prompt the user to clear options. Upon clearing, all video options will appear.

Other features worth noting:

•	Deep-linking capabilities by product – which will filter and show only products associated with the corresponding product upon page load

•	Deep-linking capabilities for each individual video. Individual videos will open in their pop-ups upon page load.

•	CSS3 hover transitions

It was integrated as its own landing page. Each video offers shoppable product combinations and how-to’s  with product carousel and user generated content.
